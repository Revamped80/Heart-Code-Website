      <h4>Impact on High Schoolers:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Nearly <span class="stat">70%</span> of cardiac arrests happen outside of the hospital, and about <span class="stat">90% </span>of those people will die. </li>
        <li>Evidence suggests that over <span class="stat">6,000</span> children die outside of the hospital from a sudden cardiac arrest each year.</li>
        <li>It’s important to teach children and teens CPR so that they can save a life. Studies have shown that kids as young as <span class="stat">9</span> can learn CPR.</li>

     <h1 class="source-titled"> How to perform CPR?</h1>
      <ul class="howCPR">
        <li> <span class="stat"> Check if the person is responsive: </span>Make sure the area is safe and the person didn’t briefly pass out. Tap the person on the shoulder and shout, “Are you ok?” If they don’t respond, continue with these steps.</li>
        <li>  <span class="stat"> Assign duties:</span> If there are other people around you, assign someone specifically to call 911 and another to get an AED. Because these situations can feel crowded and chaotic, make eye contact, or say that person’s name to assign tasks. If there is no one around you, dial 911 and put your phone on speaker. Begin the CPR steps right away while you’re communicating with the first responder on the phone.</li>
        <li> <span class="stat">Assess whether to start CPR or get an AED: </span>  If it’s a child, you’ll start CPR right away without searching for an AED. That’s because it’s more likely an airway issue – you don’t need to take the time to get the AED. If you’re helping an adult, you’ll want to get the AED right away because it’s likely a heart issue.</li>
        <li> <span class="stat">Check for breathing:</span> Make sure the person is on their back on a firm surface. Tilt the head back slightly to open the airway and listen for breathing. If you don’t hear or see breathing, you can begin CPR. You don’t need to check for a pulse.</li>
        <li> <span class="stat">Start chest compressions: </span> When you start CPR, place your hands one on top of the other interlocking fingers in the middle of the chest on the sternum, just above the nipple line. Keep your arms straight and use your body weight to help compress the chest. For adults (and adult-size kids), compress the chest at least 2 inches deep and at least 1/3 of the chest depth for younger children. Those compressions should be delivered at 100-120 compressions per minute. You can hum the song “Staying Alive” to help keep time or count out loud.</li>

      <h3>Why CPR Matters:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediate CPR <span class="stat">doubles/triples survival odds.</span></li>
        <li>70% of cardiac arrests occur <span class="highlight">outside</span> hospitals.</li>
        <li>Bystander CPR boosts survival to <span class="stat">45%.</span></li>
        <li>Children as young as <span class="stat">9 years</span> can effectively learn CPR.</li>
        <li>Over <span class="stat">30 states</span> mandate CPR training for graduation.</li>
        <li>Teens can execute <span class="highlight">"Call-Push-Shock"</span> protocol effectively.</li>
        <li>Survival drops <span class="stat">10% per minute</span> without CPR.</li>
        <li>Peer rescue is possible during sports, labs, or concerts.</li>
